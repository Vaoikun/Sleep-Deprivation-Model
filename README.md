# Sleep-Deprivation-Model
# Αuther: Dallin Wise, Luke Robinson, Tyler Pace, Vance Williams
In this project, we develop and analyze ODE models of the glymphatic system, focusing on soluble and fibrillar amyloid-β, in order to investigate efficient strategies for obtaining sufficient sleep. Using our results, we examine whether it is possible to recover lost sleep and explore alternative sleep strategies for achieving adequate rest.
